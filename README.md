# Next.js 15 "Remix Contacts" Rebuild V2

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It is a second rebuild of [Remix Contacts](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/start/tutorial) using Next.js 15 with Server Actions, Tailwind CSS, and Prisma.
It does not use a global transition handler anymore, but instead uses local transitions and useFormStatus. I have also improved the design, css and folder structure since V1.

See branches `react-hook-form` and `react-query` for modified app versions.

## Requirements

- Installed Node.js
- Installed Visual Studio Code

## Usage

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Prisma Setup

Add a `.env` file to the root of the project, refer to `.env.sample` for the required environment variables.
You need decide between prisma local development with `sqlite` or a real database with for example `sqlserver`. Define it in the `schema.prisma` file.

After switching, delete the `prisma/migrations` folder before running the migration command.

When using sqlserver, you need to migrate the database schema with:

```bash
npm run prisma.migrate
```

When using sqlite, initialize with:

```bash
npm run prisma.push
```

Seed prisma/seed.ts for initial data:

```sh
npm run prisma.seed
```

To view your data in the database, you can run:

```bash
npm run prisma.studio
```

## Development Info

### Development Tools

The project uses [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting. The configuration for these tools is located in `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc.js`. The project is configured to run code formatting and linting on save in Visual Studio Code. Verify that code formatting and linting is executed on save as configured. Opening the `.code-workspace` file will ensure the correct extentions are set.

### Naming Conventions

- Pascal case for components
- Kebab case for folders
- Camel case for other files

### Folder Structure

- `public` - contains the static assets of the application
- `src` - contains the source code of the application
- `src/app` - contains the pages of the application using file based routing.
- `src/components` - contains shared components used across the application. The same goes for the other shared folder like `providers`, `hooks`, `utils`, etc.
- For each route, a local `_components`-folder can be used to store components that are only used in that route. Same goes for `_hooks`, `_utils`, etc.
- `src/data` - contains server-side data fetching and mutations.

Every page folder should contain everything it needs to work. And every component or function should live at the nearest shared space in the hierarchy.

### Routing

The project uses Next.js filesystem-based routing. To give a brief overview:

- Folders below the `app/`-directory will be routes in the application.
- For each folders inside `src/app` that is meant to be a route, there should be a `page.tsx` and alternatively `layout.tsx` for the route.
- When using brackets `[]` in the name of a folder, the folder will be a dynamic route. The name of the folder will be the name of the parameter in the route.
- There are additional tools, such as ignoring folders from routing by prefixing with `_`, and creating groups by wrapping with `()`.
- Each route can also have a `error.tsx` file for handling application errors, and a `not-found.tsx` page for handling 404 errors with notFound().

Please refer to the [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) documentation for more information.

#### Note on Type-Safe Routing

In the Next.js App Router, routes, route params and search params are not typed by default. Therefore, [next-safe-navigation](https://github.com/lukemorales/next-safe-navigation) is used for type-safe navigation. All routes are defined in `src/validations/routeSchema.ts` and can be used by calling `routes.<routeName>`.

In client components, parsing params is done with the hooks `useSafeParams` and `useSafeSearchParams`. For server components, the `pageProps` are passed down as an unknown object and validated with `routes.<routeName>.$parseParams` and `routes.<routeName>.$parseSearchParams`.

### Note on React 19

The Next.js App Router uses React 19 Server Components, and by default all components are server components unless opted into client-side rendering with `"use client"`. In addition, the project uses other React 19 features such as Server Functions, `useFormStatus()`, `useOptimistic()`, `useActionState()`, and async transitions with `useTransition()`. Please read the [React docs](https://react.dev/reference/react) on these features to understand how to use them. Read more about the use of Server Functions under [Data Fetching and Mutation](#data-fetching-and-mutation).

### Note on the React Compiler

The project uses the React Compiler to optimize the application. The React Compiler is a new feature in React that optimizes the application by skipping rerenders and expensive functions calls, and removes the need for much manual momoization. The compiler is enabled in the `next.config.ts` file. It's currently in Beta, and everything it working well. Pay attention to it's behavior, and try to follow the eslint rules for it defined by `eslint-plugin-react-compiler`. Refer to the [React Compiler documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler) for more information.

### Styling

The project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to rapidly build custom designs without leaving your HTML. The theme is configured in `tailwind.config.js`. Default styles are applied in `/app/globals.css`.

Use the `cn` util when merging conditional classes with other classes. Excess styling is applied in the components using Tailwind CSS utility classes. Tailwind also controls the responsive design of the application with a mobile-first approach. Refer to the Tailwind CSS documentation for more information.

### Data Fetching and Mutation

The project uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for data fetching. Mutations are done using React Server Functions, skipping the Next.js 12 `/api` convention. Files are stores inside the `src/data` folder, where `src/data/services` are server-side data queries and `src/data/actions` are mutations. Take extra consideration when creating hidden endpoints with "use server" to avoid exposing sensitive data.

For more information, refer to the [React Server Functions](https://19.react.dev/reference/rsc/server-functions) and [Next.js Server Actions and Mutations](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) documentation.

When using a form with an action, the loading state is included in the `SubmitButton`-component, and the form is disabled while the action is pending. For other cases, a loading state can be passed to to submit button or other components to handle the loading state.

## Deployment

The app can be built for production using the `npm run build` command. The built files will be generated in the `.next` folder.

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
